Did some mall walking the other day, because why not?

*what a crowd*

The escalator was out between two of the four floors. A woman who did not appear overly obese or ill in any way (although, admittedly, who really knows) could barely make it up single flight of a non-automated steps. A friend of hers had to support her by holding her arm. She seemed not so much concerned about her physical condition as by the calamity of the escalator being out of order. Granted, I am one of those jerkoffs who walk both up and down escalators, but nevertheless I suppose some people just have different concerns about their lives than I do.
